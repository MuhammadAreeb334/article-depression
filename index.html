                <h2>What is depression?</h2>
                <p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes persistent feelings of sadness,
                 emptiness, and loss of joy. It is different from the mood fluctuations that
                 people regularly experience as a part of life. Major life events, such as bereavement
                 or the loss of a job.But depression is distinct from the negative feelings a person may
                 temporarily have in response to a difficult life event. Depression often persists in
                 spite of a change of circumstances and causes feelings that are intense, chronic,
                 and not proportional to a person’s circumstances.</p>

                <p>While there is no cure for depression, there are effective treatments that help
                 with recovery. The earlier that treatment starts, the more successful it may be.

                 Others will continue to have relapses.Many people experiencing depression
                 recover after a treatment plan. Even with effective treatment, however, a relapse
                 may occur. About halfTrusted Source of people do not initially respond to treatment. 
                 To prevent relapse, people who take medication for depression should continue
                 with treatment — even after symptoms improve or go away — for as long as their doctor 
                 advises. </p>
